                <p className="mb-6">Kids ask big questions. How did that get made? Who thought of that? Why does it work that way?</p>
                
                <p className="mb-6">At Founders for Kids, we answer with real stories about real creators. Not fairy tales—true accounts of people who built something from nothing.</p>
                
                <p className="mb-6">Our first three books hit shelves this month. Each one takes you behind the scenes where the magic really happens: the failed prototypes, the midnight breakthroughs, the moments when giving up seemed like the only option (but wasn't).</p>
                
                <p className="mb-6">Why focus on founders? Because behind every great creation stands a person with an idea and the courage to pursue it. Our books showcase the extraordinary perseverance, grit, and hard work that bring ideas to life.</p>
                
                <p className="mb-6">We share stories of people who kept going when others stopped. People whose creativity solved difficult problems. People who turned rejections into fuel and mistakes into stepping stones.</p>
                
                <p className="mb-6">Our mission is clear: to inspire and teach the next generation of bold dreamers and doers. Because the world needs their special ideas and determination—now more than ever.</p>
                
                <p className="mb-6">I can't wait to hear which story becomes your child's favorite. Or better yet, to someday read the story of what your child created through their own perseverance after reading one of our books.</p>
