Born in 1963 in Taipei, Taiwan, Jensen moved to the United States as a child and developed an early fascination with computers and their potential."}],["$","p","1",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"After earning degrees in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and Stanford University, Jensen began his career at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and later became a director at LSI Logic.

The name NVIDIA comes from the Latin word \"invidia,\" meaning \"envy\"—fitting for a company that would make others envious of its technological breakthroughs."}],["$","p","3",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"The early years were challenging. Jensen's team competed in the crowded market of graphics chip makers, often working long hours in a small office above a Denny's restaurant. Their breakthrough came in 1999 with the release of the GeForce 256, marketed as the world's first \"GPU\" and capable of handling complex 3D graphics processing that was previously impossible on personal computers."}],["$","p","4",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Jensen's leadership style combined technical insight with bold decision-making. He famously wore a leather jacket at company events, creating a distinctive personal brand in the tech world. More importantly, he maintained a focused vision for NVIDIA, even when it meant making difficult choices. In the early 2000s, when the company faced fierce competition, Jensen made the controversial decision to abandon lower-end graphics cards and focus exclusively on high-performance products—a strategy that ultimately proved successful."}],["$","p","5",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"NVIDIA's most significant transformation came when Jensen recognized that GPUs could be used not just for graphics but for scientific computing and, eventually, artificial intelligence. The company developed CUDA, a platform that allowed its GPUs to solve complex mathematical problems for various fields. This pivot positioned NVIDIA at the center of the AI revolution, as its GPUs became essential for training sophisticated neural networks."}],["$","p","6",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Today, NVIDIA's technology powers everything from gaming PCs to self-driving cars, weather prediction systems, and the world's fastest supercomputers.
