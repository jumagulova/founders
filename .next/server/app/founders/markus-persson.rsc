After completing his schooling, he worked as a game developer for King.com (now known for Candy Crush) and later as a programmer for Jalbum, a photo-sharing service."}],["$","p","2",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"In his spare time, Markus participated in programming competitions and worked on personal projects. In 2009, inspired by games like Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress, he began developing a new game called \"Cave Game,\" which would soon be renamed Minecraft."}],["$","p","3",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"What made Minecraft revolutionary was its open-ended nature and simple yet flexible building system. Players could gather resources and use blocks to build virtually anything they could imagine—from simple shelters to elaborate castles, working computers, and entire cities. The game had no specific goals beyond survival, giving players unprecedented freedom to create and explore."}],["$","p","4",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Markus released an early version of Minecraft in May 2009 on the TIGSource forum, charging a small fee for access. Word spread quickly through gaming communities, and a dedicated fanbase began to grow. Rather than following traditional game development methods, Markus used an \"alpha funding\" model, selling the unfinished game at a discount and using the funds to continue development while incorporating player feedback."}],["$","p","5",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"By 2010, sales had increased enough for Markus to quit his day job and found Mojang, a company dedicated to developing Minecraft and other games. The game officially launched in November 2011, by which time it had already sold over 4 million copies during its beta phase—an extraordinary achievement for an independent game with minimal marketing."}],["$","p","6",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Minecraft's appeal crossed age barriers, attracting both children and adults. Its blocky, pixelated graphics—initially a necessity due to development constraints—became its signature style. The game found particular success in education, where teachers used it to teach everything from math and history to computer programming."}],["$","p","7",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"In September 2014, Markus made a surprising announcement: he was selling Mojang and the rights to Minecraft to Microsoft for $2.5 billion. After the sale, he stepped away from active game development, occasionally working on smaller projects."}],["$","p","8",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Minecraft's legacy continues to grow. With over 300 million copies sold across all platforms, it ranks as the best-selling video game of all time.
