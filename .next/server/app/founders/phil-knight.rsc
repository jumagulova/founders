With a $500 loan from his father, he traveled to Japan and secured the U.S. distribution rights for Tiger shoes (now known as Asics). Back home, he partnered with his former coach Bowerman, each investing $500 to form Blue Ribbon Sports—the company that would eventually become Nike."}],["$","p","3",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"The early days were humble—Phil sold shoes from his car at track meets while maintaining his day job as an accountant.

Rather than just selling shoes, he sold an idea—that anyone could be an athlete. The 1988 \"Just Do It\" campaign transformed Nike from a running shoe company into a global lifestyle brand. Phil also pioneered athlete endorsements, most famously signing rookie basketball player Michael Jordan in 1984, creating the Air Jordan line that revolutionized sports marketing."}],["$","p","7",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Throughout Nike's growth, Phil maintained a rebellious spirit and fostered an innovative corporate culture that valued athletes and sports above all.
