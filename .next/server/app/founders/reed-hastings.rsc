Upon returning to the United States, he earned a master's degree in computer science from Stanford University and began his career in software development."}],["$","p","2",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"In 1991, Reed founded his first company, Pure Software, which created tools for debugging software. The company grew rapidly, eventually going public before merging with Atria Software and being acquired by Rational Software. This experience taught Reed valuable lessons about managing fast-growing companies, though he later admitted feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of leading a large organization."}],["$","p","3",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"The idea for Netflix came in 1997 after Reed was charged a $40 late fee for returning \"Apollo 13\" well past its due date. This frustrating experience sparked a question: What if there was a movie rental service with no late fees? Along with co-founder Marc Randolph, Reed launched Netflix as a DVD-by-mail service with a revolutionary subscription model—customers could keep DVDs as long as they wanted with no late fees, receiving new discs when they returned the ones they had."}],["$","p","4",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Netflix's early years were challenging. The company competed with Blockbuster, which had over 9,000 stores worldwide, compared to Netflix's zero physical locations. Reed offered to sell Netflix to Blockbuster for $50 million in 2000, but Blockbuster declined—a decision that would prove monumentally misguided as Netflix grew and Blockbuster eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2010."}],["$","p","5",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Reed's most visionary move came in 2007 when Netflix introduced streaming video, allowing subscribers to watch content instantly on their computers. At the time, internet speeds were just becoming fast enough to support video streaming, and Reed positioned Netflix at the forefront of this technological shift. In 2013, Netflix took another bold step by creating original content, beginning with \"House of Cards\"—a move that transformed the company from a distribution platform into a production studio."}],["$","p","6",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Throughout Netflix's growth, Reed implemented innovative management practices. He eliminated vacation tracking, believing employees should be treated as responsible adults. He also developed a unique corporate culture centered on \"freedom and responsibility,\" detailed in a famous 125-page culture deck that has been viewed millions of times and influenced companies worldwide."}],["$","p","7",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"Under Reed's leadership, Netflix grew from a small DVD rental service to a global entertainment powerhouse with over 230 million subscribers in more than 190 countries. The company's success fundamentally changed not just how people watch TV and movies but how content is produced and distributed."}],["$","p","8",{"className":"mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"After serving as CEO for 25 years, Reed stepped down in January 2023, transitioning to the role of executive chairman.
